1. Main class is  "TwitterToKafkaServiceApplication"
2. We are injecting 2 dependencies which are "StreamRunner" and "StreamInitializer"
3. Implementation of this custom interface StreamRunner is provided in "KafkaStreamInitializer" class
4. In "KafkaStreamInitializer" we are checking if kafka topics are created and schema registry is up and running
5. Implementation of "StreamInitializer" interface is given in "MockKafkaStreamRunner" class
6. "simulateTwitterStream" method of class "MockKafkaStreamRunner" is getting called via start method and in separate thread we are creating mock tweets
7. After creating tweets we need to send it to kafka topics
8. So from there we are calling "onStatus" method of "TwitterToKafkaStatusListener"
9. There firstly we acre getting Avro model from the status we just created 
10. Then calling "send: method of custom interface "KafkaProducer"
11. We have implemented "KafkaProducer" in the class "TwitterkafkaProducer"
12. In KafkaProducer class then we are sending data to kafka topic
13. But nature of this send method is of ListenableFuture future hence it will work in async way
14. We have implemented onSuccess and onFailure for this ListenableFuture
